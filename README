This is the beginning of lab2. Ahead of the curve!!!

Problem with draw function drawing the launcher:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./game.py", line 48, in <module>
    launcher.draw(surf)
TypeError: unbound method draw() must be called with launcher instance as first argument (got Surface instance instead)
